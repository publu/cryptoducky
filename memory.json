      "Currently, I'm able to create a new ERC-20 token with specific details like name, symbol, and initial supply. However, the ability to set decimal precision or make the token mintable isn't supported directly through my available functions. \n\nYou can create a token named \"Duck\" with an initial supply, and for advanced features like setting decimals or making it mintable, I recommend modifying the smart contract code directly. You can implement this using the Coinbase Developer Platform SDK. You can find more information in the [Coinbase SDK documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com).\n\nIf you need help implementing it, let me know, and I can provide some guidance or example code!"
